content: "Jack (29) & Jill (28) Have been dating for 2 years and wanted to move in together but didn’t want to pay somebody else’s mortgage in the form of paying rent. So they decide to invest in condo together. Their parents both approved of their decision to invest together but warned them to protect themselves and always be prepared for the worst case scenario.

While going through the process of getting a mortgage approval they shopped around at a couple banks and a mortgage brokerage for rates.
The bank mortgage specialist spoke to them about default mortgage insurance (CMHC), should they put less than 20% down payment.
Then they were offered their in house mortgage insurance on the outstanding balance of the mortgage should anything happen to either of them in terms of unexpected death, critical illness and disability.

They were very confused.

When they spoke to the mortgage broker. They were able to offer a better rate on the mortgage and better service in terms of walking them through the different steps in their first home purchase. This clarified the 3 different types of insurances that are involved in the purchase of a property.

Mortgage default insurance (CMHC): Required by all financial institutions in Canada for mortgage loans with less than 20% down payment. To protect the Canadian economy from a mortgage crisis should people default on their mortgage payments.

“Home Insurance” : this is required by the notary when signing for the mortgage. Proof of insurance is mandatory. This is fire, theft, vandalism and liability insurance should anything happen to physical property and its contents.

“Mortgage insurance” relates to protecting the individual owners of the property and the liability they have taken on in the form of a mortgage to be able to purchase the property.
Banks offer this in house coverage that is more similar to credit protection that basically protects the creditor (the bank) more than the clients taking the mortgage.

The mortgage broker went on to explain that getting personal insurance is a much better option. And they should explore this with a professional.

The mortgage broker then referred them to a financial security advisor to discuss how personally owned insurance to protect the mortgage is much more comprehensive and tailored to your overall financial situation.

Jack and Jill  met with a financial security advisor who went into detail about the difference between bank mortgage insurance and personally owed insurance and at the same time they saw the value in the big picture. After a discovery meeting, the financial security advisor made some solid recommendations that gave them piece of mind with their recent investment. Knowing they are both fully covered should anything happen to them and their ability to pay their mortgage.

Finally they decided to invest in the proposed recommendation from the financial security advisor recommended by their mortgage broker.

Term life insurance guaranteed for 25 years for the balance of their mortgage
Term critical illness insurance  guaranteed for 25 years for the balance of their mortgage

Which came out to less per month than what they spend on car insurance!"
